# Solved

- make row drag working with while sorting other columns
- pagination issues
- sort default bug - not a bug but its default for id columns
- outside column handler - through storybook
- live update of data
- custom elements as a prop
- custom cells and column config
- custom sorting functionality
- custom state handling and method accessability
- serious handling for props vs state changes listeners
- search functionality - not available in library - external effect from container
  Additional data can be added as a prop or handled separately
  search function doesn't keep row drag state, unless its handled separately
- states can be fully controlled by overwriting handler methods
- custom pagination component support
- toggle props for drag
